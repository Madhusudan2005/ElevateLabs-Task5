# AI & ML Internship - Task 5: Decision Trees and Random Forests

This project is a solution for Task 5, focusing on predicting heart disease using Decision Tree and Random Forest models.

The process involved training a Decision Tree, pruning it to manage overfitting, and comparing its performance against a more accurate Random Forest model. Key predictive features were identified using feature importance, and the final model was evaluated with cross-validation.

The Random Forest classifier achieved the highest accuracy. The most significant features for prediction were `ca` (number of major vessels), `thalach` (max heart rate), and `cp` (chest pain type).

**Tools Used:** Python, Scikit-learn, pandas, Matplotlib
